# TV-Control-Indicator
An Ubuntu Panel Indicator to control a TV connected to PC using CEC and XRandR

### Requirements:
* CEC compatible TV and HDMI cable
* TV connected via HDMI
* [PulseEight USB Adapter](https://www.pulse-eight.com/p/104/usb-hdmi-cec-adapter)
* [LibCEC](https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec)
* XRandR
* Distro compatible with Ubuntus Application Indicators

### Issues:
* It's been developed for personal use, so the physical address of my TV has been hardcoded.
* I don't have many CEC capable devices so testing has been limited to Samsung Anynet only.
